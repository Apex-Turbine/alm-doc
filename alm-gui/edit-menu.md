1. **License Type**: This Option sets the license mode as Node Locked License File or License Server
2. **Port**: This option sets the port that the ALM and all APEX applications will communicate through. The port is automatically generated by the operating system on the first launch of the ALM.&#x20;
3. **Custom Port:** The port can be changed by checking the Custom Port box or manually in the environment variable file. Changing the port will require a restart of the ALM.
