# Edit Menu

This menu option is only available in the ALM GUI.

1. **Options**: Opens a window with the following options. These options are saved in the .env.apexlm environment variable file. More on this file later. The options are as follows:
2. **License Type**: This Option sets the license mode as License File, License Server, or OpenCode.
3. **Port**: This option sets the port that the ALM and all APEX applications will communicate through. The port is automatically generated by the operating system on the first launch of the ALM. But it can be changed here or manually in the environment variable file. Changing the port will require a restart of the ALM.
