The ALM will run automatically in the background after successful installation. This is referred to as the ApexLM Daemon.&#x20;

The GUI version is optional and must be launched explicitly from the Start menu, File Explorer, or command line terminal.&#x20;

On windows, a popup may show asking you to allow the ALM in the firewall. If the ALM has been manually shut down, it can be launched via the start menu under APEX -> APEX License Manager.&#x20;

Note: If the ALM was previously configured in license server mode and fails to connect to a license server, it may take up to 60 seconds to finish launching.&#x20;

If for some reason the ALM does not launch, terminate ApexLM.exe in the task manager and relaunch it from the start menu.
